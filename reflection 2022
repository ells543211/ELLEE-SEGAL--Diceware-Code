Over the course of this project, I learned how to load strings and map them on the console. I used if statements to deturmine the words appended as well as updating the assignment to have a word limit. I struggled originally with coming up with an idea of how to generate a password but am overal happy with how I applied lookup keys and specific functions/ variables to accomplish my vision. One problem I orginally hoped to change was how the password would keep adding on words for forever. Once it hit a certain limit, the password got too long and made the test too small. I went back and decided to improve how many words fit in a screen to improve it. One specific function I learned for clarification is key pressed where if the key was pressed, it would append a variable and add a new word using lookup key!
